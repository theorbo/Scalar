/* You have an array A with N elements. We have two types of operation available on this array :
We can split an element B into two elements, C and D, such that B = C + D.
We can merge two elements, P and Q, to one element, R, such that R = P ^ Q i.e., XOR of P and Q.
You have to determine whether it is possible to convert array A to size 1, containing a single element equal to 0 after several splits and/or merge?
