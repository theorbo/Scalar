/* 
N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.

The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.  */
